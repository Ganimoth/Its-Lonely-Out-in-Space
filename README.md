A game made in 48 hours for the Kenney Game Jam 2023. It's Lonely Out in Space is an atmospheric game where you pilot a ship in space. 
Avoid walls, blast threats with your laser, explore and find upgrades, and reach the end!

This game was made in Godot 4.1, the entire project was done within the time constraints of the game jam so the code is not as polished as I would like it to be. 
Still, if you're interested how it's made, here you go! You can also check the commits to see when everything was made.
